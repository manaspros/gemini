# Gemini Project (Copy)

This is a copy of the Gemini project that I am working on. It aims to provide advanced AI functionalities for various applications.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understand and generate human language for chatbots, summarization, and more.
- **Image Recognition**: Analyze and classify images for applications like automated tagging and content moderation.
- **Data Analysis**: Provide insights through data mining and visualization, helping users make informed decisions.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest products or content based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Automation Tools**: Streamline workflows with AI-driven automation for repetitive tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-project.git
    cd gemini-project
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

To make this project work, you need to add your API key to the `src/config/gemini.js` file.

1. Open the file `src/config/gemini.js`.
2. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:
    ```js
    const config = {
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
        // other config options
    };

    export default config;
    ```

3. Save the file.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
